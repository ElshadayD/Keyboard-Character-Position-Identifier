Keyboard Character Position Identifier
This repository contains a simple Python script that maps characters to their positions on a standard QWERTY keyboard. The script allows users to input a character and retrieves its corresponding position on the keyboard.

Overview
The script defines a function get_keyboard_position(char) that takes a character as input and returns its position on the keyboard. The keyboard layout is represented as a dictionary, and the user can input any valid character to get its position.
